## Preamble (run first)

```bash
_UPD=$(~/.claude/skills/gstackplusplus/bin/gstackplusplus-update-check 2>/dev/null || .claude/skills/gstackplusplus/bin/gstackplusplus-update-check 2>/dev/null || true)
[ -n "$_UPD" ] && echo "$_UPD" || true
mkdir -p ~/.gstackplusplus/sessions
touch ~/.gstackplusplus/sessions/"$PPID"
_SESSIONS=$(find ~/.gstackplusplus/sessions -mmin -120 -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
find ~/.gstackplusplus/sessions -mmin +120 -type f -delete 2>/dev/null || true
_CONTRIB=$(~/.claude/skills/gstackplusplus/bin/gstackplusplus-config get gstackplusplus_contributor 2>/dev/null || true)
_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
echo "BRANCH: $_BRANCH"
_LAKE_SEEN=$([ -f ~/.gstackplusplus/.completeness-intro-seen ] && echo "yes" || echo "no")
echo "LAKE_INTRO: $_LAKE_SEEN"
```

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: read `~/.claude/skills/gstackplusplus/gstackplusplus-upgrade/SKILL.md` and follow the "Inline upgrade flow" (auto-upgrade if configured, otherwise AskUserQuestion with 4 options, write snooze state if declined). If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: tell user "Running gstack++ v{to} (just updated!)" and continue.

If `LAKE_INTRO` is `no`: Before continuing, introduce the Completeness Principle.
Tell the user: "gstack++ follows the **Boil the Lake** principle — always do the complete
thing when AI makes the marginal cost near-zero. Read more: https://garryslist.org/posts/boil-the-ocean"
Then offer to open the essay in their default browser:

```bash
open https://garryslist.org/posts/boil-the-ocean
touch ~/.gstackplusplus/.completeness-intro-seen
```

Only run `open` if the user says yes. Always run `touch` to mark as seen. This only happens once.

## AskUserQuestion Format

**ALWAYS follow this structure for every AskUserQuestion call:**
1. **Re-ground:** State the project, the current branch (use the `_BRANCH` value printed by the preamble — NOT any branch from conversation history or gitStatus), and the current plan/task. (1-2 sentences)
2. **Simplify:** Explain the problem in plain English a smart 16-year-old could follow. No raw function names, no internal jargon, no implementation details. Use concrete examples and analogies. Say what it DOES, not what it's called.
3. **Recommend:** `RECOMMENDATION: Choose [X] because [one-line reason]` — always prefer the complete option over shortcuts (see Completeness Principle). Include `Completeness: X/10` for each option. Calibration: 10 = complete implementation (all edge cases, full coverage), 7 = covers happy path but skips some edges, 3 = shortcut that defers significant work. If both options are 8+, pick the higher; if one is ≤5, flag it.
4. **Options:** Lettered options: `A) ... B) ... C) ...` — when an option involves effort, show both scales: `(human: ~X / CC: ~Y)`

Assume the user hasn't looked at this window in 20 minutes and doesn't have the code open. If you'd need to read the source to understand your own explanation, it's too complex.

Per-skill instructions may add additional formatting rules on top of this baseline.

## Completeness Principle — Boil the Lake

AI-assisted coding makes the marginal cost of completeness near-zero. When you present options:

- If Option A is the complete implementation (full parity, all edge cases, 100% coverage) and Option B is a shortcut that saves modest effort — **always recommend A**. The delta between 80 lines and 150 lines is meaningless with CC+gstack++. "Good enough" is the wrong instinct when "complete" costs minutes more.
- **Lake vs. ocean:** A "lake" is boilable — 100% test coverage for a module, full feature implementation, handling all edge cases, complete error paths. An "ocean" is not — rewriting an entire system from scratch, adding features to dependencies you don't control, multi-quarter platform migrations. Recommend boiling lakes. Flag oceans as out of scope.
- **When estimating effort**, always show both scales: human team time and CC+gstack++ time. The compression ratio varies by task type — use this reference:

| Task type | Human team | CC+gstack++ | Compression |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Boilerplate / scaffolding | 2 days | 15 min | ~100x |
| Test writing | 1 day | 15 min | ~50x |
| Feature implementation | 1 week | 30 min | ~30x |
| Bug fix + regression test | 4 hours | 15 min | ~20x |
| Architecture / design | 2 days | 4 hours | ~5x |
| Research / exploration | 1 day | 3 hours | ~3x |

- This principle applies to test coverage, error handling, documentation, edge cases, and feature completeness. Don't skip the last 10% to "save time" — with AI, that 10% costs seconds.

**Anti-patterns — DON'T do this:**
- BAD: "Choose B — it covers 90% of the value with less code." (If A is only 70 lines more, choose A.)
- BAD: "We can skip edge case handling to save time." (Edge case handling costs minutes with CC.)
- BAD: "Let's defer test coverage to a follow-up PR." (Tests are the cheapest lake to boil.)
- BAD: Quoting only human-team effort: "This would take 2 weeks." (Say: "2 weeks human / ~1 hour CC.")

## Contributor Mode

If `_CONTRIB` is `true`: you are in **contributor mode**. You're a gstack++ user who also helps make it better.

**At the end of each major workflow step** (not after every single command), reflect on the gstack++ tooling you used. Rate your experience 0 to 10. If it wasn't a 10, think about why. If there is an obvious, actionable bug OR an insightful, interesting thing that could have been done better by gstack++ code or skill markdown — file a field report. Maybe our contributor will help make us better!

**Calibration — this is the bar:** For example, `$B js "await fetch(...)"` used to fail with `SyntaxError: await is only valid in async functions` because gstack++ didn't wrap expressions in async context. Small, but the input was reasonable and gstack++ should have handled it — that's the kind of thing worth filing. Things less consequential than this, ignore.

**NOT worth filing:** user's app bugs, network errors to user's URL, auth failures on user's site, user's own JS logic bugs.

**To file:** write `~/.gstackplusplus/contributor-logs/{slug}.md` with **all sections below** (do not truncate — include every section through the Date/Version footer):

```
# {Title}

Hey gstack++ team — ran into this while using /{skill-name}:

**What I was trying to do:** {what the user/agent was attempting}
**What happened instead:** {what actually happened}
**My rating:** {0-10} — {one sentence on why it wasn't a 10}

## Steps to reproduce
1. {step}

## Raw output
```
{paste the actual error or unexpected output here}
```

## What would make this a 10
{one sentence: what gstack++ should have done differently}

**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD} | **Version:** {gstack++ version} | **Skill:** /{skill}
```

Slug: lowercase, hyphens, max 60 chars (e.g. `browse-js-no-await`). Skip if file already exists. Max 3 reports per session. File inline and continue — don't stop the workflow. Tell user: "Filed gstack++ field report: {title}"

## Step 0: Detect base branch

Determine which branch this PR targets. Use the result as "the base branch" in all subsequent steps.

1. Check if a PR already exists for this branch:
   `gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName`
   If this succeeds, use the printed branch name as the base branch.

2. If no PR exists (command fails), detect the repo's default branch:
   `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name`

3. If both commands fail, fall back to `main`.

Print the detected base branch name. In every subsequent `git diff`, `git log`,
`git fetch`, `git merge`, and `gh pr create` command, substitute the detected
branch name wherever the instructions say "the base branch."

# Pre-Landing PR Review

You are running the `/review` workflow. Analyze the current branch's diff against the base branch for C++ structural issues that tests don't catch: memory safety, undefined behavior, thread safety, and API design problems.

## Design Principles: KISS · DRY · SOLID · YAGNI

Apply these four principles throughout all analysis, recommendations, and fixes.
They are listed in priority order — when they conflict, prefer the earlier one.

| Principle | Priority | What it means in C++ | Watch for |
|-----------|----------|----------------------|-----------|
| **YAGNI** — You Ain't Gonna Need It | 1 (highest) | Build for today's requirements. No template parameters for hypothetical future types, no virtual methods before you have two concrete implementations, no generalization beyond the current use case. | Template type params with one instantiation, virtual methods with one override, `// will be useful when…` comments, policy classes with no alternate policy |
| **KISS** — Keep It Simple | 2 | Prefer the simplest solution that works. No clever metaprogramming when a plain function suffices. Write for the engineer debugging at 3 am. | Multi-level template specialisations for a single case, SFINAE chains that could be `if constexpr`, `auto`-everything obscuring types, "clever" one-liners that need a comment to explain themselves |
| **DRY** — Don't Repeat Yourself | 3 | Every piece of knowledge has one authoritative home. Factor repeated logic into shared helpers, base classes, or macros of last resort. | Same algorithm in two files, copy-pasted error-handling blocks, duplicated constants, parallel `switch` statements that must always change together |
| **SOLID** | 4 | **S**ingle Responsibility · **O**pen/Closed · **L**iskov Substitution · **I**nterface Segregation · **D**ependency Inversion. Each class does one thing; extend by addition not modification; subtypes are drop-in replacements; interfaces are minimal; dependencies are injected not hard-coded. | God classes/files, `if (type == X)` dispatch that should be virtual, non-substitutable subclasses that override preconditions, fat interfaces with unrelated methods, singletons and global state that make testing impossible |

### Principle interactions in practice

- Favour **YAGNI over SOLID**: don't introduce an interface abstraction until you have two concrete implementations. One implementation = no interface needed yet.
- Favour **KISS over DRY**: a small, clear duplication is better than a clever abstraction that obscures intent. Abstract when the duplication hurts, not as soon as you see two similar lines.
- **DRY is not about lines of code** — it is about knowledge. Two functions that happen to look similar but represent independent business rules should stay separate.
- **SOLID's D (Dependency Inversion) enables testing**: if a component is hard to test in isolation, the fix is usually to inject the dependency rather than to mock globals.

## Step 1: Check branch

1. Run `git branch --show-current` to get the current branch.
2. If on the base branch, output: **"Nothing to review — you're on the base branch or have no changes against it."** and stop.
3. Run `git fetch origin <base> --quiet && git diff origin/<base> --stat` to check if there's a diff. If no diff, output the same message and stop.

---

## Step 2: Read the checklist

Read `.claude/skills/review/checklist.md`.

**If the file cannot be read, STOP and report the error.** Do not proceed without the checklist.

---

## Step 2.5: Check for Greptile review comments

Read `.claude/skills/review/greptile-triage.md` and follow the fetch, filter, classify, and **escalation detection** steps.

**If no PR exists, `gh` fails, API returns an error, or there are zero Greptile comments:** Skip this step silently. Greptile integration is additive — the review works without it.

**If Greptile comments are found:** Store the classifications (VALID & ACTIONABLE, VALID BUT ALREADY FIXED, FALSE POSITIVE, SUPPRESSED) — you will need them in Step 5.

---

## Step 3: Get the diff

Fetch the latest base branch to avoid false positives from stale local state:

```bash
git fetch origin <base> --quiet
```

Run `git diff origin/<base>` to get the full diff. This includes both committed and uncommitted changes against the latest base branch.

---

## Step 4: Two-pass review

Apply the checklist against the diff in two passes:

1. **Pass 1 (CRITICAL):** Memory Safety & Ownership, Undefined Behavior, Thread Safety & Data Races, Resource Management (RAII)
2. **Pass 2 (INFORMATIONAL):** API Design & Const Correctness, Magic Numbers & Coupling, Dead Code & Consistency, Test Gaps, Documentation Staleness, Embedded/Platform Concerns

**Enum & Switch Completeness requires reading code OUTSIDE the diff.** When the diff introduces a new enum value or variant, use Grep to find all switch statements and if-chains that reference sibling values, then Read those files to check if the new value is handled. This is the one category where within-diff review is insufficient.

**Memory Safety flags to check (Pass 1):**
- Raw owning pointers in new code (use `unique_ptr`/`shared_ptr` instead)
- `delete` / `delete[]` outside of RAII destructors
- Buffer access with no bounds check (pointer arithmetic, `operator[]` on raw arrays)
- Use of `reinterpret_cast` without clear alignment/aliasing justification
- `memcpy`/`memset` on non-trivially-copyable types
- Storing a raw pointer to a temporary or stack object
- `std::move` on a const object (silently copies instead)

**Undefined Behavior flags to check (Pass 1):**
- Signed integer overflow used intentionally (undefined in C++, use unsigned or `__builtin_add_overflow`)
- Left-shifting into the sign bit
- Dereferencing a pointer to a deleted object or past its lifetime
- Accessing union member other than the last-written one (outside `std::variant`)
- Returning a reference/pointer to a local variable
- Calling virtual functions in constructor/destructor (object not yet fully constructed)
- `std::string::operator[]` without bounds check where index could be out of range

**Thread Safety flags to check (Pass 1):**
- Shared mutable data accessed from multiple threads without synchronization
- `std::shared_ptr` copy without lock (reference count is atomic, pointed-to object is NOT)
- `static` local variables initialized from multiple threads (safe in C++11+ but document it)
- Lock-free code without memory ordering justification
- Condition variable without loop (spurious wakeup)
- Mutex locked in constructor, unlocked in destructor of different type (RAII inconsistency)
- `std::async` return value discarded (destructor blocks — caller must store the future)

Follow the output format specified in the checklist. Respect the suppressions — do NOT flag items listed in the "DO NOT flag" section.

## Step 4.5: API Design Review (conditional)

## API Design Review (conditional, diff-scoped)

Check if the diff touches public interface files using `gstackplusplus-diff-scope`:

```bash
eval $(~/.claude/skills/gstackplusplus/bin/gstackplusplus-diff-scope <base> 2>/dev/null)
```

**If `SCOPE_FRONTEND=false` and no header files changed:** Skip API design review silently. No output.

**If header files (.h, .hpp) appear in the diff OR `SCOPE_FRONTEND=true`:**

1. **Check for API.md.** If `API.md`, `DESIGN.md`, or similar exists in the repo root, read it. All API findings are calibrated against it — patterns blessed in API.md are not flagged. If not found, use the universal C++ API design principles below.

2. **Read `.claude/skills/review/api-design-checklist.md`.** If the file cannot be read, skip with a note: "API design checklist not found — skipping API design review."

3. **Read each changed header file** (full file, not just diff hunks). Header files are identified by .h, .hpp, .hxx extensions.

4. **Apply the API design checklist** against the changed headers. For each item:
   - **[HIGH] mechanical fix** (missing `const`, raw owning pointer, undocumented precondition): classify as AUTO-FIX
   - **[HIGH/MEDIUM] design judgment needed** (naming, error strategy, ownership model): classify as ASK
   - **[LOW] style/documentation**: present as "Consider — verify with team style guide or run /design-review"

5. **Include findings** in the review output under an "API Design Review" header, following the Fix-First flow in Step 5 — AUTO-FIX for mechanical fixes, ASK for everything else.

6. **Log the result** for the Review Readiness Dashboard:

```bash
eval $(~/.claude/skills/gstackplusplus/bin/gstackplusplus-slug 2>/dev/null)
mkdir -p ~/.gstackplusplus/projects/$SLUG
echo '{"skill":"design-review-lite","timestamp":"TIMESTAMP","status":"STATUS","findings":N,"auto_fixed":M}' >> ~/.gstackplusplus/projects/$SLUG/$BRANCH-reviews.jsonl
```

Substitute: TIMESTAMP = ISO 8601 datetime, STATUS = "clean" if 0 findings or "issues_found", N = total findings, M = auto-fixed count.

Include any API design findings alongside the findings from Step 4. They follow the same Fix-First flow in Step 5 — AUTO-FIX for mechanical fixes (missing `const`, undocumented precondition), ASK for everything else.

---

## Step 5: Fix-First Review

**Every finding gets action — not just critical ones.**

Output a summary header: `Pre-Landing Review: N issues (X critical, Y informational)`

### Step 5a: Classify each finding

For each finding, classify as AUTO-FIX or ASK per the Fix-First Heuristic in
checklist.md. Critical findings lean toward ASK; informational findings lean
toward AUTO-FIX.

### Step 5b: Auto-fix all AUTO-FIX items

Apply each fix directly. For each one, output a one-line summary:
`[AUTO-FIXED] [file:line] Problem → what you did`

### Step 5c: Batch-ask about ASK items

If there are ASK items remaining, present them in ONE AskUserQuestion:

- List each item with a number, the severity label, the problem, and a recommended fix
- For each item, provide options: A) Fix as recommended, B) Skip
- Include an overall RECOMMENDATION

Example format:
```
I auto-fixed 5 issues. 2 need your input:

1. [CRITICAL] src/network/connection.cpp:42 — Use-after-free: raw pointer to Connection
   stored in callback after Connection may be destroyed
   Fix: Capture a shared_ptr<Connection> or use a weak_ptr to detect lifetime expiry
   → A) Fix  B) Skip

2. [INFORMATIONAL] include/parser/lexer.hpp:88 — Function `tokenize()` takes `char*` buffer
   with no length — buffer overread if caller passes unterminated string
   Fix: Change to `std::span<const char>` or `std::string_view`
   → A) Fix  B) Skip

RECOMMENDATION: Fix both — #1 is a real use-after-free (crash in production), #2 prevents
silent buffer overreads that are hard to detect in tests.
```

If 3 or fewer ASK items, you may use individual AskUserQuestion calls instead of batching.

### Step 5d: Apply user-approved fixes

Apply fixes for items where the user chose "Fix." Output what was fixed.

If no ASK items exist (everything was AUTO-FIX), skip the question entirely.

### Greptile comment resolution

After outputting your own findings, if Greptile comments were classified in Step 2.5:

**Include a Greptile summary in your output header:** `+ N Greptile comments (X valid, Y fixed, Z FP)`

Before replying to any comment, run the **Escalation Detection** algorithm from greptile-triage.md to determine whether to use Tier 1 (friendly) or Tier 2 (firm) reply templates.

1. **VALID & ACTIONABLE comments:** These are included in your findings — they follow the Fix-First flow (auto-fixed if mechanical, batched into ASK if not) (A: Fix it now, B: Acknowledge, C: False positive). If the user chooses A (fix), reply using the **Fix reply template** from greptile-triage.md (include inline diff + explanation). If the user chooses C (false positive), reply using the **False Positive reply template** (include evidence + suggested re-rank), save to both per-project and global greptile-history.

2. **FALSE POSITIVE comments:** Present each one via AskUserQuestion:
   - Show the Greptile comment: file:line (or [top-level]) + body summary + permalink URL
   - Explain concisely why it's a false positive
   - Options:
     - A) Reply to Greptile explaining why this is incorrect (recommended if clearly wrong)
     - B) Fix it anyway (if low-effort and harmless)
     - C) Ignore — don't reply, don't fix

   If the user chooses A, reply using the **False Positive reply template** from greptile-triage.md (include evidence + suggested re-rank), save to both per-project and global greptile-history.

3. **VALID BUT ALREADY FIXED comments:** Reply using the **Already Fixed reply template** from greptile-triage.md — no AskUserQuestion needed:
   - Include what was done and the fixing commit SHA
   - Save to both per-project and global greptile-history

4. **SUPPRESSED comments:** Skip silently — these are known false positives from previous triage.

---

## Step 5.5: TODOS cross-reference

Read `TODOS.md` in the repository root (if it exists). Cross-reference the PR against open TODOs:

- **Does this PR close any open TODOs?** If yes, note which items in your output: "This PR addresses TODO: <title>"
- **Does this PR create work that should become a TODO?** If yes, flag it as an informational finding.
- **Are there related TODOs that provide context for this review?** If yes, reference them when discussing related findings.

If TODOS.md doesn't exist, skip this step silently.

---

## Step 5.6: Documentation staleness check

Cross-reference the diff against documentation files. For each `.md` file in the repo root (README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.):

1. Check if code changes in the diff affect features, components, or workflows described in that doc file.
2. If the doc file was NOT updated in this branch but the code it describes WAS changed, flag it as an INFORMATIONAL finding:
   "Documentation may be stale: [file] describes [feature/component] but code changed in this branch. Consider running `/document-release`."

This is informational only — never critical. The fix action is `/document-release`.

If no documentation files exist, skip this step silently.

---

## Important Rules

- **Read the FULL diff before commenting.** Do not flag issues already addressed in the diff.
- **Fix-first, not read-only.** AUTO-FIX items are applied directly. ASK items are only applied after user approval. Never commit, push, or create PRs — that's /ship's job.
- **Be terse.** One line problem, one line fix. No preamble.
- **Only flag real problems.** Skip anything that's fine.
- **Use Greptile reply templates from greptile-triage.md.** Every reply includes evidence. Never post vague replies.
